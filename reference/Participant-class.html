<dd><p>Checks if this participant's data are valid based on passed arguments.
    This method aims to identify participants who had too few responses or
    varied their response colors too little, by marking them as invalid.
    Note that there are no absolutely correct values, as what is 'too little
    variation' is highly subjective. You might need to tweak parameters to be
    in line with your project's criteria, especially if you use another color
    space than CIELUV, since the default values are based on what seems
    to make sense in a CIELUV context. If you use the results in a
    research article, make sure to reference synr and specify what parameter
    values you passed to the function.</p>
<p>This method relies heavily on the DBSCAN algorithm and the package
    'dbscan', and involves calculating a synr-specific 'Total Within-Cluster
    Variance' (TWCV) score. You can find more information, and
    what the parameters here mean, in
    the documentation for the function <code>validate_get_twcv</code>.</p><div class="section">
<h3 id="parameters">Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameters"></a></h3>
<p></p><ul><li><p><code>min_complete_graphemes</code> The minimum number of graphemes
          with complete (all non-NA color) responses that the participant data
          must have for them to not be categorized as invalid based on this
          criterion. Defaults to 5.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbscan_eps</code> Radius of 'epsilon neighborhood' when applying
          DBSCAN clustering. Defaults to 20.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbscan_min_pts</code> Minimum number of points required in the
          epsilon neighborhood for core points (including the core point
          itself). Defaults to 4.</p></li>
<li><p><code>max_var_tight_cluster</code> Maximum variance for an identified
          DBSCAN cluster to be considered 'tight-knit'. Defaults to 150.</p></li>
<li><p><code>max_prop_single_tight_cluster</code> Maximum proportion of
          points allowed to be within a single 'tight-knit' cluster (exceeding
          this leads to classification as invalid). Defaults to 0.6.</p></li>
<li><p><code>safe_num_clusters</code> Minimum number of identified DBSCAN
          clusters (including 'noise' cluster only if it consists of at least
          'dbscan_min_pts' points) that guarantees validity if
          points are 'non-tight-knit'. Defaults to 3.</p></li>
<li><p><code>safe_twcv</code> Minimum total within-cluster variance (TWCV)
          score that guarantees validity if points are 'non-tight-knit'.
          Defaults to 250.</p></li>
<li><p><code>complete_graphemes_only</code> A logical vector. If TRUE,
          only data from graphemes that have all non-NA color responses
          are used; if FALSE, even data from graphemes with some NA color
          responses are used. Defaults to TRUE.</p></li>
<li><p><code>symbol_filter</code> A character vector (or NULL) that specifies
          which graphemes' data to use. Defaults to NULL, meaning data from
          all of the participant's graphemes will be used.</p></li>

symbols in the passed vector are returned.</p></dd>


<dt><code>get_consistency_scores(

<dd><p>Returns a list of grapheme symbols with associated consistency scores.
      If na.rm = TRUE, for each grapheme a consistency score calculation is
      forced (except if ALL response colors associated with the grapheme
      are NA). That probably isn't what you want, because it leads to things
      like a perfect consistency score if all except one response color are
      NA. Defaults to na.rm = FALSE.</p>
<p>If a character vector is passed to
      symbol_filter, only consistency scores for graphemes with symbols

<p>Use the method argument to specify what kind of color space

      the base R dist function for all options)</p></dd>


<dt><code>get_grapheme_mean_colors(symbol_filter = NULL, na.rm = FALSE)</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns a list of grapheme symbols with associated mean colors,
      using the color space set at participant creation. Colors are represented
      by 3-element vectors.</p>
<p>Example: if color space is RGB, vector element 1 represents
      grapheme mean R value, element 2 mean G value, element 3
      B value.</p>
<p>If na.rm = TRUE, for each grapheme a mean color is calculated even
      if one its associated response colors is missing. Defaults to

<p>If na.rm = FALSE, calculates the mean consistency score if
      all of the participants' graphemes only have response
      colors that are non-NA, otherwise returns NA.
      If na.rm = TRUE, returns the mean consistency score for
      all of the participant's graphemes that only have
      non-NA response colors, while ignoring graphemes
      that have at least one NA response color value. Note that
      NA is returned in either case, if ALL of the participants'
      graphemes have at least one NA response color value.</p>
<p>If a character vector is passed to
      symbol_filter, only data from graphemes with symbols

<dt><code>get_mean_response_time(symbol_filter = NULL, na.rm = FALSE)</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the mean response time, with respect to all
Grapheme instances associated with the participant.
Weights response times based on number of valid responses
that each grapheme has. If na.rm = TRUE, returns mean response
time even if there are missing response times. If na.rm = FALSE,
returns mean response time if there is at least one response time
value for at least one of the participants' graphemes. If a
character vector is passed to symbol_filter, only data from
graphemes with symbols in the passed vector are used when
calculating the mean response time.</p></dd>


<dt><code>get_nonna_color_resp_mat(symbol_filter = NULL)</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns an n-by-3 matrix of all non-NA color responses' data,

color. If a character vector is passed to symbol_filter,
only data from responses associated with graphemes with corresponding
symbols are included.</p></dd>

<dd><p>Returns average of all of participants' registered
      response colors (based on the color space
      set at participant initialization) as a 3-element vector.
      Example: if color space is RGB, element 1 represents

      cut-off score recommended by Rothen, Seth, Witzel &amp; Ward (2013)
      for the L*u*v color space. If mean_line = TRUE, the plot will

<p>Pass a value to grapheme_size to adjust the size of graphemes
      shown at the bottom of the plot, e. g. increasing the size if
      there's a lot of empty space otherwise, or decreasing the size if the
      graphemes don't fit. The grapheme_angle
      argument allows rotating graphemes. grapheme_spacing is for adjusting
      how far grapheme symbols are spaced from each other.</p>
<p>If a character vector is passed to symbol_filter, only data for graphemes
      with symbols in the passed vector are used.</p>
<p>Graphemes are sorted left-to-right by 1. length and

<p>If save_dir is not specified, the plot is saved to the current
