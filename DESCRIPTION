Title: An Interface To Synesthesia Consistency Test Data
Version: 0.1
Author: Lowe Wilsson
Maintainer: Lowe Wilsson <datalowe@posteo.de>
Description: This is a package for working with data resulting from 
             grapheme-color consistency tests for synesthesia. It relies
             heavily on Reference Classes, which means that how the
             package works might be a bit different from what you're
             used to in R. Hopefully you'll find that what might seem
             unfamiliar at first becomes intuitive and powerful once
             you've learned about it. Please read the vignette
             'synr: Package, summarize and visualize synesthesia 
             consistency test data' for a tutorial
             on how to use the package.
